# YouTube Playlist length calculator

This module allows you to check the total length of a user's ***public*** YouTube playlist using the YouTube Data API.

This can be used as a starter template to implement the backend API functionality in your own project. If you are looking for an easy way to see the length of your own playlists or 'Watch later' list, take a look at [THIS PROJECT](https://github.com/Juninger/YouTube-watch-later-length-calculator) instead!

    üîë An API key for the YouTube Data API.

    üÜî The playlist ID of the YouTube playlist you want to check.
